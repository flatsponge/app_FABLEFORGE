# Product Guidelines - StoryTime

## Design Philosophy
StoryTime employs a "Dual-Experience" design strategy. It provides a clean, management-focused interface for parents and a highly immersive, interactive environment for children.

## Visual Identity
### Parent-Facing UI (Growth & Settings)
- **Tone:** Professional, Trustworthy, and Minimalist.
- **Color Palette:** Soft neutrals with secondary accent colors (e.g., Indigo or Slate) to denote "Growth" and "Analytics."
- **Typography:** Clean Sans-Serif fonts (e.g., System font or Inter) for maximum legibility of progress metrics.
- **Components:** Well-spaced cards, subtle shadows, and clear data visualizations for the "Leos Growth" section.

### Child-Facing UI (Child Hub & Reading)
- **Tone:** Whimsical, Vibrant, and Gamified.
- **Color Palette:** High-energy primary and secondary colors (e.g., Sunny Yellow, Deep Purple, Sky Blue).
- **Typography:** Playful, rounded fonts to feel approachable and "magical."
- **Interaction:** Large touch targets, haptic feedback, and animated transitions to make character "dress-up" and navigation feel like a game.

## Brand Voice & Messaging
- **For Parents:** Encouraging and informative. Focus on "nurturing," "milestones," and "values."
- **For Children:** Direct, celebratory, and imaginative. Focus on "rewards," "adventures," and "fun."

## Gamification Principles
- **Progress Loop:** Reading is the core activity that drives progression.
- **Milestone Rewards:** Loot drops and cosmetic items are awarded at specific milestones (e.g., every 3 books read) to maintain long-term engagement.
- **Visual Rewards:** Cosmetic items (hats, capes, etc.) must be visually distinct and exciting.
- **Personalization:** The custom character should be the focal point of the child's UI.
