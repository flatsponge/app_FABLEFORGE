# Product Guide - StoryTime

## Initial Concept
An Expo app that generates AI storybooks for children, focused on personal growth and values. It features a gamified loop where children earn cosmetics for their characters by reading stories. Parents can create stories using the child's customized character and familiar environments (like their room) to increase involvement.

## Product Vision
StoryTime aims to revolutionize bedtime stories by making them deeply personal and interactive. By blending AI narration, character customization, and pedagogical value-building, the app creates a healthy "reading loop" for children and a powerful tool for parents to guide their child's development.

## Target Audience
- **Children:** Primary users who interact with the "Child Hub," dress up their characters, and read/listen to stories.
- **Parents:** Co-creators who generate custom stories and monitor their child's growth and value development.

## Core Features
- **AI Story Generation:** Custom stories tailored to the child's needs, improving specific values (e.g., kindness, courage).
- **Gamified Character System:** A "Child Mode" where kids earn loot and cosmetics through reading to customize their avatar.
- **Environmental Integration:** The ability to set stories in familiar locations like the child's own bedroom.
- **Narrative Modes:** 
  - **Read-Along/Auto Mode:** AI-voice narration for younger children.
  - **Child Mode:** Interactive reading for children to practice themselves.
- **Parental Involvement:** Tools for parents to use the child's custom character in new stories to maximize engagement.

## Value Proposition
Unlike generic story apps, StoryTime uses high-level personalization and gamification to turn reading into a rewarding journey that directly contributes to a child's character growth and values.
